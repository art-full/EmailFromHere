Email CSV data from here

I'm trying to write a Python script to pull data from one csv sheet to send status to managers. Another csv will have a static mailing list. 

My plan is to first create separate sheets for each manager. 
Then the emails for each manager. 
Third, I want to write a bit of summary info in the body and subject of each outlook email.
